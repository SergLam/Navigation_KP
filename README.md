Defining motion parameters of aircraft on the track data

Hi guys!
This is my course project for the navigation of aircraft!
Objective: from a text file read GPS-reciever data (GPGGA lines) show the trajectory of ship on Google Maps, 
and calculate its motion parameters (speed, true heading, distance traveled) and display them on the charts.
I was to lazy to build charts in QtCreator, so I save data to *xls file. 
You can open it via Microsoft Exel, and build plots there with help of few mouse clicks!
